# Asteroid-diameter-detection
Neural network created in C# to detect asteroid diameter. Dataset was analyzed and preprocessed in python (Jupyter notebook).

Add database from https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter?select=Asteroid_Updated.csv and paste it to bin/Debug/Data.
The program purpose is to test neural network performance. <br>
Recommended low epoch value for training. <br>
Note: There is a little bug, that after loading the weigths you have to also train NN for some epochs to get real value when checking the performance. <br>
